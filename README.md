# PainTreatment
Study proves the success of pain treatment and analyse its impact on the society.

# Abstract
# Aim
The aim of this study was to examine the success of pain treatment on patients and analyze its dependency on factors like age, gender and existence of other illness in patients. Impact of Pain on the patient's employment status was also analyzed in the study. 
# Methods
This study was designed as a retrospective observational study to evaluate the success of pain treatment between two different groups. Multi-centre, randomized, examiner and subject blind, two parallel-group designs were chosen for the study. McGill Pain score and Rolland Morris Pain score was documented at two-time intervals before and after treatment for the 110 patients who were given treatments at 7 different center locations across Ireland. Average of both the scores were then calculated at respective time intervals and was used to identify a reduction in pain.  
# Results
Patients on an average reported pain at 5 different pain sites, maximum pain sites reported for the patient was 15. Average worst pain of 9.01, average present pain of 6.13, average all-time pain of 6.94 and average pain intensity of 7.35 was reported by patients at time interval T1 on a scale of 1 to 10. 
On an average pain, the score was reduced by 2.78 units ranging from 1.29 to 4.23 with 95% confidence interval for the PGAP group of patients who were given the treatment while for the MTAU control group of patient average pain reduction was only 0.30 units. Treatment was not affected by the Age (P-value 0.483), Gender (P-value 0.614) and the existence of other illness (P-value 0.945) in patients. 
Employment status of 65 or 73.07% of the patients was highly impacted due to pain while 22 patients have a comparatively lower impact while 2 of the patients shows no impact on the employment status.
# Conclusion
Treatment was successful in reducing pain in the PGAP group of patients and was independent of patients' age, gender or existence of other illness. Employment status of patients was highly impacted due to pain and thus the success of treatment will create a huge impact on the society.
